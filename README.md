# Netflix Clone (MERN Stack)

## Project Overview

This Netflix Clone is a full-stack web application developed to simulate the core features of Netflix. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), it was created as part of my journey to learn and strengthen my skills in full-stack development.

The project demonstrates proficiency in integrating a front-end React.js application with a back-end Node.js/Express server and managing data with MongoDB. While it's not an exact replica of Netflix, it includes essential functionality like browsing content, a detailed homepage, and authentication features.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure signup and login functionality using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Content Browsing**: Users can browse a catalog of movies and TV shows with images and descriptions.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with modern UI practices, the front-end is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across devices.
  
## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## Learning Outcomes

This project helped me:
- Strengthen my understanding of React.js for building user interfaces.
- Gain experience in building a RESTful API with Node.js and Express.js.
- Work with MongoDB for data management and perform CRUD operations.
- Learn about user authentication and secure password management.
